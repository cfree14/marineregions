# Marine regions and other GIS data for the ocean

## Overview

This R packages contains GIS data for the ocean. Many of the datasets are from the iconic [marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/) website. All of the datasets are made available as ['sf' objects](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). Please contact me (cfree14@gmail.com) if there are datasets you would like to see added to the package.

## Installation

The "marineregions" R package can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
# Run if you don't already have devtools installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Run once devtools is successfully installed
devtools::install_github("cfree14/marineregions", force=T)
library(marineregions)
```

## Datasets

The package contains 'sf' objects (think shapefiles for R) presenting the following datasets:

1. Large Marine Ecoregions (LMEs): `?lmes`
2. Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOWs): `?meows`
3. Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs): `?eezs`
4. FAO major fishing areas: `?fao_areas`
